# IBOutlets and UILabels

### Objectives
* Define `IBOutlet`s and their role in iOS development
* Discuss and implment `UILabel`s

### Tasks
Follow the `TODO` comments in the code to implement the topics outlined in the lecture

### Notes
* Places where code should be implemented are marked with `TODO` comments and will appear as warnings in the Issue navigator when building the project
* A __SwiftLint__ build script has been added for convenience
