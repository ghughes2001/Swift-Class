# IBActions and More UI Components

### Objectives
* Discuss and implement UI components such as `UIButton`, `UISwitch`, `UIImageView` and `UIImage`
* Discuss accessing architectual iOS components such as `Assets` and `Bundle`

### Tasks
Follow the `TODO` comments in the code to implement the topics outlined in the lecture

### Notes
* Places where code should be implemented are marked with `TODO` comments and will appear as warnings in the Issue navigator when building the project
* A __SwiftLint__ build script has been added for convenience
