# MVC and Delegation

### Objectives
Discuss `MVC` architecture in iOS and implement a custom `Delegate`

### Tasks
Follow the `TODO` comments in the code to implement the topics outlined in the lecture

### Notes
* Places where code should be implemented are marked with `TODO` comments and will appear as warnings in the Issue navigator when building the project
* A __SwiftLint__ build script has been added for convenience
